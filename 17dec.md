## Todayâ€™s activities 
This morning we attended a stakeholder meeting at Hornsby council with reps from Heritage around Me. The meeting provided us with insights into Heritage on a more local level as well as a greater understanding of the OEH's strategy for the around me program. (This will probably need to be written up)
Kenni also gave me a crash course in GitHubing, .csv and markdown files/coding/i have no idea what i'm talking about. THat was super helpful and got me pumped to do things.
Now OEH xmas party. Woot



## Blockers 
 * Yet to consult with end users. Again, tomorrow!
 * Hornsby is quite far away
